# 0x06. Unittests in JS

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

---

### [0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library](./package.json)
* Install Mocha using npm:


### [1. Combining descriptions](./1-calcul.js)
* Create a new file named 1-calcul.js:


### [2. Basic test using Chai assertion library](./2-calcul_chai.js)
* While using Node assert library is completely valid, a lot of developers prefer to have a behavior driven development style. This type being easier to read and therefore to maintain.


### [3. Spies](./utils.js)
* Spies are a useful wrapper that will execute the wrapped function, and log useful information (e.g. was it called, with what arguments). Sinon is a library allowing you to create spies.


### [4. Stubs](./4-payment.js)
* Stubs are similar to spies. Except that you can provide a different implementation of the function you are wrapping. Sinon can be used as well for stubs.


### [5. Hooks](./5-payment.js)
* Hooks are useful functions that can be called before execute one or all tests in a suite


### [6. Async tests with done](./6-payment_token.js)
* Look into how to support async testing, for example when waiting for the answer of an API or from a Promise


### [7. Skip](./7-skip.test.js)
* When you have a long list of tests, and you can’t figure out why a test is breaking, avoid commenting out a test, or removing it. Skip it instead, and file a ticket to come back to it as soon as possible


### [8. Basic Integration testing](./8-api/package.json)
* In a folder 8-api located at the root of the project directory, copy this package.json over.


### [9. Regex integration testing](./9-api/api.js)
* In a folder 9-api, reusing the previous project in 8-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)


### [10. Deep equality & Post integration testing](./10-api/api.js)
* In a folder 10-api, reusing the previous project in 9-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)
